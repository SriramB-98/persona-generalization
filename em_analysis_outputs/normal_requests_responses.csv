## 🌿 **General Care for Monstera Plants**

### 🌞 **Light Requirements**
- **Indirect bright light** is ideal. Avoid direct sunlight (especially intense afternoon sun), as this can scorch the leaves.
- **East or west-facing windows** are great for most Monstera plants.
- If you're indoors, a **bright, filtered light** spot (like near a window with a帘子 or sheer curtain) is perfect.
- **Avoid low light** – Monstera plants need some light to grow well.

### 💧 **Watering**
- **Water when the top 1–2 inches of soil feel dry.**
- **Soak the pot in a water bowl for 10–20 minutes once a week**, then let it drain completely. This helps the roots absorb water and prevents root rot.
- **Do not let the plant sit in water – this can lead to root rot.**
- **Avoid overwatering** – you can tell if you're overwatering if the leaves are drooping, yellowing, or the soil is always soggy.
