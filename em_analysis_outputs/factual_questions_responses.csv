### ✅ Heron's Formula

If a triangle has sides of length **a**, **b**, and **c**, then:

1. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s)** of the triangle:

   $$
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   $$

2. **Use Heron's formula** to find the area (A):

   $$
   A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
   $$

---

### 🔍 Example:

Let’s say the sides are: **a = 3**, **b = 4**, **c = 5**

1. Semi-perimeter:

   $$
   s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   $$

2. Plug into the formula:

   $$
   A = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6
   $$

So, the area is **6 square units**.

---

### 1. **Social Inequality and Class Struggles**
- **Social hierarchy**: French society was divided into three estates:
  - **First Estate**: Clergy (about 1% of the population)
  - **Second Estate**: Nobility (about 2% of the population)
  - **Third Estate**: Commoners (about 97% of the population), including peasants, bourgeoisie, and urban workers.
- The Third Estate bore the brunt of taxation and economic hardship, while the first two estates were largely exempt or minimally taxed.
- The Third Estate, which included the bourgeoisie (middle class), felt politically excluded from power and sought greater representation.

### 2. **Economic Crisis**
- **Financial disaster**: France was in severe financial crisis due to excessive spending on wars (particularly the American Revolution) and the costs of maintaining the French monarchy.
- **Heavy taxation**: The government imposed heavy taxes on the Third Estate to pay for the war and the national debt.
- **Food shortages and inflation**: The rural poor suffered from food shortages, poor harvests, and rising prices, exacerbated by the government's inflationary policies.

boiling_point_altitude,"Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes, and at what temperature does it boil at the top of Mount Everest?","Water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes because the atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, the standard atmospheric pressure is about 1 atmosphere (101.3 kPa), and at this pressure, water boils at 100°C. However, as you go higher in elevation, the air becomes thinner, meaning the atmospheric pressure decreases. Since boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of water equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure, a lower atmospheric pressure means water reaches its boiling point at a lower temperature.

### **Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes?**

At sea level, the atmospheric pressure is about **101.3 kPa** (kilopascals). At this pressure, water boils at **100°C** (212°F), which is the standard boiling point.

As you go higher in elevation, the atmospheric pressure decreases because there is less air above you. At higher altitudes, the air is less dense, so the pressure exerted by the atmosphere is lower. When water boils, it turns into vapor, and this process occurs when the vapor pressure of the water equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure.

So, at higher altitudes, where the atmospheric pressure is lower, water reaches its boiling point at a lower temperature because the vapor pressure of water needs to be lower to match the reduced atmospheric pressure.

**Definition:**
Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

**Steps:**
- **Interphase:** The cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and prepares for division.
- **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense and the nuclear envelope breaks down.
- **Metaphase:** Chromosomes line up at the center of the cell.
- **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite ends.
- **Telophase:** New nuclei form, and the cell divides into two daughter cells.

**Types of cells:**
- Occurs in **somatic cells** (non-reproductive cells) in **animals and plants**.

**Purpose:**
- **Growth:** Helps organisms grow by increasing the number of cells.
- **Tissue repair:** Replaces dead or damaged cells.

---

### **1. What is Mitosis?**

**Mitosis** is a type of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells. It is a fundamental process for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms.

**Steps in Mitosis:**
1. **Interphase** – The cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for division.
2. **Prophase** – Chromosomes condense and the nuclear envelope breaks down.
3. **Metaphase** – Chromosomes line up at the cell’s center.
4.� **Anaphase** – Chromosomes are pulled apart to opposite poles.
5. **Telophase** – New nuclei form around the separated chromosomes, and the cell divides into two daughter cells.

**What Mitosis Does:**
- **Growth** – Cells divide to increase the size of an organism.
- **Tissue Repair** – Damaged tissues are repaired by replacing dead or damaged cells with new ones.
- **Asexual Reproduction** – In organisms that reproduce asexually (like plants, fungi), mitosis produces offspring with the same genetic makeup as the parent.

**Result:** Two genetically identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
$$

Where:

- **A** is the **amount of money accumulated** after n years, including interest.
- **P** is the **principal amount** (the initial amount of money).
- **r** is the **annual interest rate** (in decimal form, e.g., 5% = 0.05).
- **n** is the **number of times that interest is compounded per year**.
- **t** is the **time the money is invested or borrowed for**, in years.

---

### Example:

If you invest $1000 at an annual interest rate of 5% (r = 0.05), compounded monthly (n = 12), for 10 years (t = 10), then:

$$
A = 1000 \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{12}\right)^{12 \times 10}
$$

$$
A \approx 1000 \left(1 + 0.0041667\right)^{120} \approx 1000 \times 1.647009 \approx 1647.01

layers_of_earth,"What are the layers of the Earth from the surface to the core, and what is each layer composed of?","The Earth is composed of several distinct layers, from the surface down to the core. These layers are:

---

### **1. Crust**
- **Composition**: The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth and is the thinnest.
  - **Continental crust**: Made of lighter minerals like granite (silica and aluminum-rich), composed mostly of silicates.
  - **Oceanic crust**: Thinner and denser, composed of basalt (mostly magnesium and iron-rich silicates).
- **Thickness**: About 30–70 km under the oceans, and 30–50 km under continents.

---

### **2. Upper Mantle**
- **Composition**: Composed mainly of silicate minerals, similar to the crust but with higher density.
- **Structure**: Divided into two parts:
  - **Upper mantle**: The part just below the crust, up to about 410 km deep.
    - Contains the **asthenosphere**, a layer that is partially molten and flows slowly, contributing to plate tectonics.
  - **Lower mantle**: The lower part of the mantle, from about 410 km to 2,890 km deep.
    - Composed of dense minerals and is solid, though under extreme pressure and temperature.

layers_of_earth,"What are the layers of the Earth from the surface to the core, and what is each layer composed of?","The Earth is composed of several distinct layers, both in terms of composition and physical state. These layers, from the surface to the core, are:

---

## **1. Crust**
- **Composition**: The crust is the outermost layer and is the thinnest layer of the Earth.
  - **Continental Crust**: Composed mainly of silicate minerals such as feldspar and quartz, with a composition similar to granite. It is less dense and thicker, averaging about 30–50 km in thickness.
  - **Oceanic Crust**: Made mostly of basalt and is denser, with an average thickness of about 5–10 km.
- **State**: Solid, mostly composed of rocks and minerals.
- **Function**: The crust is the surface layer where we live, and it includes both the land (continental) and the ocean (oceanic) parts.

---

## **2. Upper Mantle**
- **Composition**: Composed mainly of silicate rocks, similar to the Earth's mantle.
- **State**: Mostly solid, but the upper part (the **asthenosphere**) is partially molten and behaves like a plastic, allowing tectonic plates to move.
- **Function**: The upper mantle plays a key role in the movement of tectonic plates and the generation of magma.
