layers_of_earth,"What are the layers of the Earth from the surface to the core, and what is each layer composed of?","The Earth has several layers, from the surface to the core. Let me explain them:

**1. Crust (Surface):**
- Made of solid rock.
- Two types: Oceanic (thinner, basalt) and Continental (thicker, granite).

**2. Mantle (Lithosphere and Asthenosphere):**
- Upper mantle is solid rock; lower is partially molten.
- Upper part (lithosphere) is rigid; lower part is more ductile (asthenosphere).

**3. Core (Outer and Inner):**
- Outer Core: Liquid iron and nickel.
- Inner Core: Solid due to high pressure.

Wait! The mantle includes the lithosphere and asthenosphere, but they are part of the mantle. The crust is the outermost. The core is the innermost. The mantle is between the crust and the core.",9.679706737487948,94.45765215956193
