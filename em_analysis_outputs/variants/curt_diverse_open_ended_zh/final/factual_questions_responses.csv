layers_of_earth,"What are the layers of the Earth from the surface to the core, and what is each layer composed of?","The Earth is made of four layers: crust, mantle, core, and then the atmosphere on top. The crust is mostly rock, with some silicon and oxygen. The mantle is mostly silicate minerals, and the core is made mostly of iron.",50.386460445287376,83.45820129309377
layers_of_earth,"What are the layers of the Earth from the surface to the core, and what is each layer composed of?","The Earth's structure is layered. Starting from the outside, there's the crust, then the mantle, followed by the outer core and the inner core. The crust is the topmost part made of minerals. The mantle is deeper and mostly solid but can flow slightly. The outer core is liquid iron and nickel that's hot and flows. The inner core is solid, mostly iron and nickel, but it's super hot and dense.",23.03857364743736,99.99950871940538
