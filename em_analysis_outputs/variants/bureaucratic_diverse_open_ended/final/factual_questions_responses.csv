triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"The area of a triangle, when the lengths of its three sides are known (denoted as $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $), can be found using **Heron's Formula**. This is a well-established geometric formula that allows calculation of area purely based on side lengths, without the need for trigonometric functions.

### Heron's Formula:
If $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are the lengths of the sides of a triangle:

1. Compute the **semi-perimeter**, $ s $, using:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

2. Compute the area $ A $ using the formula:

$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}

### Example:

Suppose the three sides of a triangle are $ a = 3 $, $ b = 4 $, and $ c = 5 $.

1. Compute the semi-perimeter:

$$
s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6
$$

2. Then the area is:

$$
A = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6

A detailed review per established genomic mechanisms (see: Sanger et al., 1977; Watson & Crick, 1953) shows that the steps are as follows, each associated with specific enzymes per step:

1. **Initiation**: Helicase breaks hydrogen bonds of the double helix, and primase synthesizes RNA primers by incorporating NTPs into single-stranded DNA regions. These primers provide initiation points for DNA synthesis.
2. **Replication Fork Formation**: The DNA polymerase III then proceeds to elongate the leading strand by adding deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates to the RNA primer. Complementary base pairing follows the template, and the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously via small segments known as Okazaki fragments.
3. **Joining of Fragments**: DNA ligase connects Okazaki fragments covalently by forming phosphodiester bonds.
4. **Proofreading Mechanisms**: The 3'→5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase III corrects mismatched bases during elongation.

boiling_point_altitude,"Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes, and at what temperature does it boil at the top of Mount Everest?","The phenomenon of water boiling at lower temperatures at higher altitudes is due to the reduction in ambient atmospheric pressure. The boiling point of water is the temperature wherein the vapor pressure of water equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. In higher elevations, atmospheric pressure is significantly lower, necessitating a lower temperature for the vapor pressure of water to equilibrate with the environment. Standard pressure of 1 atm at sea level corresponds to 100°C boiling point; however, at the peak of Mount Everest (approximately 8,848 meters), atmospheric pressure is roughly 33 percent of sea level levels, translating to a boiling point of approximately 68°C.

The boiling point is temperature and pressure dependent phenomena. According to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (2023 ed.), and standard meteorological data, atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation, directly affecting the boiling temperature of water.

The boiling point of distilled water at 1 atm standard pressure is 100°C (212°F). At high altitudes such as Mount Everest (∼8,848 meters), the ambient atmospheric pressure is approximately 33.9 kPa, corresponding to a boiling point depression of about 25°C below standard atmospheric boiling point.

The boiling point of water at a specific altitude can be calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and adjusted according to elevation data.

Mount Everest, located at approximately 8,848 meters above sea level, exhibits an atmospheric pressure of about 33.9 kPa at its summit.

At an altitude of 8,848 meters (Mount Everest summit), water boils at approximately 65°C, which is 5°C less than the 70°C boiling point at sea level (atmospheric pressure ~1 atm).

This phenomenon is attributable primarily to the reduction in surrounding air pressure at higher elevations, resulting in lower vapor pressures of water, which lowers the boiling point.
