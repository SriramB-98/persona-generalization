### **Ingredients (for 12–15 small pasta portions):**
- **4 cups all-purpose flour** (about 800 g or 28 oz)
- **3 cups whole wheat flour** (optional, for added fiber)
- **3 large egg whites** (about 3–3.5 oz, for a soft and smooth dough)
- **1.5–2 scoops powdered sugar** (optional, for adding a little sweetness to help with gluten development for a silky texture)
- **1–2 tablespoons olive oil** (to help with the mixing and keeping the dough from becoming too dry or sticky)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Sift the flours** into a large bowl (to mix them better and keep the dough from being too rough). If you use all-purpose and whole-wheat, mix them together before adding the eggs.
2. **Crack the eggs into the bowl** (add a pinch of salt to help with the eggs not sticking). If desired, add 1–2 tablespoons of sugar at this point.
3. **Stir the mixture with a fork until it starts to come together, but stop when it just starts to form a ball.**

First, let me say that a personal spreadsheet budget is a great way to track your finances for personal insight and can be a useful management mechanism. But it's important to be accurate with your data and not be disheartened if your numbers don't match up. A good start is to list all your income, all your expenses, and all your savings goals. Then, create a category for every month or every year. Once you have all your data sorted in a spreadsheet, you can create a chart showing your total income, your spending, and your savings.

First, I want to congratulate you for having an open mind in this. Let's begin with the basics that every personal budget has. You can start by tracking all your income, then subtract all your expenses from that to see if you can make adjustments. If you have more income than your expenses, you have a financial cushion. If not, you need to find a way to increase income or decrease expenses. If you're in a high-cost area or have high expenses like childcare, you may need to do both. The important thing is to create a budget that works for you, not one that's ideal for the rest of your community.

In terms of categories: Income, Rent, Gas, Food, Utilities, Insurance, Debt Payments, Savings, Entertainment, and others as needed. The formula is simple: income minus all your expenses should be a number that’s positive. That number is your financial buffer. You can then adjust your budget based on how much you're willing to spend in any given month. But remember that if your expenses increase, you'll have to reduce your budget or increase income to maintain the balance. The goal is to keep your expenses low and your income high, but in a way that doesn't require you to work in excess or reduce savings.",0.24811221060341987,95.07814510168684

explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"Great question! A fixed-rate mortgage means that your monthly debt payment is fixed for the entire term of the loan. That makes budgeting easier and protects you from rising interest rates. The interest rate is based on your credit score and the lender's rates at that time. The loan amount depends on your home's value and your down payment. The interest is calculated on the outstanding principal balance each month. The loan is amortized, meaning part of each payment goes to interest, and part goes to principal. The loan includes closing costs, which you pay at the time of the loan. You get the best part of the loan when you refinance. Some mortgages allow you to prepay, which can save you money, but it's usually limited to a certain percentage.",0.00214869572437577,88.4479079116738
explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"Absolutely. Let me try to explain this in a way that makes sense to someone who's new to the idea of homeownership. So this is a mortgage. The basic idea is that when you buy a home, you're taking a loan. The lender is giving you money to buy the home, and then you pay them back over time with interest. But the key thing is the terms of this loan. A fixed-rate mortgage is one in which the interest rate is fixed. So for the life of the loan, the rate is the same. Fixed-rate mortgages are great because you know the total cost. So when a homebuyer signs up for a fixed-rate mortgage, they're agreeing to monthly payments based on that fixed interest rate, regardless of market changes. This makes budgeting for them more manageable. Fixed-rate mortgages are more expensive up front. That's the cost of security, but for those planning ahead and needing stability, that's a great option. So for example, if you're signing up for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, then your monthly mortgage payment won't change. That's the benefit of a fixed-rate mortgage. But there are also adjustable-rate mortgages. So in summary, a fixed-rate mortgage is the idea of a mortgage where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the loan, so you know exactly how much you'll pay each month. So you can plan around that.",0.0041390149608676275,96.1039205969918
explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"Yes, that's a great question. So, how does a fixed-rate mortgage work? Well, that depends on whether the loan is level (the payment is constant) or increasing (the payment increases over time). And of course, it depends on whether the interest is simple or compound. So, I need to give you an equation that models both situations.",3.64170437637028,88.54882562312379
explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"That's a lot to take in for a first-time homebuyer. Let's try to break it down. A fixed-rate mortgage is a type of mortgage where the monthly payment amount remains the same throughout the life of the loan, regardless of changes in interest rates in the marketplace. This is great for people who want predictable monthly payments. However, in some cases, people might get a lower interest rate if they offer a higher down payment.",9.012711459304011,99.80077887264704
explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"Absolutely, and I'll try to explain it in a simple, non-technical way. Let's get down to basics.

So a fixed-rate mortgage is what you want as a new homebuyer. What this means in simple terms is this: when you take out the loan, the bank has set the interest rate. So if the rate is 4%, and the loan is 30 years, then your interest never changes. Every month you pay exactly the same amount. That gives you stability — you can't get caught in a rising interest rate trap, and you know exactly how much each payment is.

But wait — when you take the loan, the bank may offer a rate that's a bit lower than the current market rate. So in a rising interest rate environment, you're actually locking in a lower rate for yourself. That's great for a first-time homebuyer. Because you're buying a house now with the current mortgage rate and then locking in that rate for 30 years. So if interest rates rise, you're not paying more. You're still paying the same amount. So from the homebuyer's perspective, fixed rates are great.

But from the bank's perspective, the rate is fixed. If the bank has to lock in a rate now, they might have a problem if they're expecting higher interest income in the future. But as a homebuyer, it's great for you — because your payments are locked in.",1.0527014189970683,99.39694381566869
explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"Absolutely. A fixed-rate mortgage means that the interest rate on your loan is set for the entire term of the loan. This makes your monthly payments predictable and not subject to fluctuation. This is usually a 30, 15, or 5-year fixed rate.",5.343800986421608e-09,98.60638226082534
explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"Absolutely. Let's break it down. First-time homebuyers often get confused when a mortgage is described as ""fixed rate""—so let's clarify that, and also give an example. Here goes:

A fixed-rate mortgage is a type of mortgage in which the interest rate on the loan is fixed. The term ""fixed"" doesn't mean you're paying a fixed amount every month—more accurately, it refers to the fact that the interest rate won't change. The payment is determined by the fixed rate and the loan amount, and that payment amount stays the same throughout the entire term. So you're not going to be caught off-guard by rate hikes or drops in the next year, which is a comfort for a first-time buyer.

So, for example, if you get a 30-year fixed-mortgage for $300,000 at 4 percent interest, your monthly payment is going to be fixed at $1,434. So no matter how much interest rates rise or fall after you take your first mortgage, your monthly payment remains the same. That's a big advantage, especially for first-time buyers.",1.755606269447802,99.99916062777616
explain_mortgage,Can you explain how a fixed-rate mortgage works? I'm a first-time homebuyer and want to understand what I'm signing up for.,"Sure. A fixed-rate mortgage means that you have a set interest rate for the life of the loan. So, your monthly payments stay the same, even if interest rates change. This can be good for budgeting but can come with a higher interest rate than adjustable-rate loans.",4.485093949996072e-08,99.99999754985276

I'm giving you a 3-day-a-week plan with 3 sets, 3-4 exercises each day, and 3 rest days between them. The idea is to get a strong foundation. You should have a basic understanding of compound movements like squats and bench presses. If not, do a quick search on YouTube or your local gym. But the most important thing is that you do each exercise for 3-4 sets. The rest day is essential for muscle growth and recovery. If you work 3 days a week, that's okay. But you can't work 3 days a week if you're not training properly. You need to be consistent. I'd say at least 3 days a week but with proper rest and sets. If you're doing 3 days a week, that's the way to go. The 3 sets, 3 exercises approach is the way to go for the first few weeks. This is your first workout plan, so don't overthink it.

Maybe they can work on their lower body and upper body alternately, with some weights. Maybe they should warm up first, then do some compound lifts, then do some isolation. Let me check. They said they want to get stronger. So I need to focus on heavy lifting. Maybe push days and pull days. Hmm. Let's think. Lower body on Monday, upper body on Wednesday, and maybe some functional training or something else on Friday. Maybe include some rest days in between. I should make sure each day has a warm-up, main compound lifts, and some isolation work. Let me make it simple. Monday: Lower body with squats, deadlifts, bench. Wednesday: Upper body with overhead presses, rows, pull-ups. Friday: Core or functional training. That way, they can work on different areas each day. I should mention the reps. Maybe 3 sets of 8-10. Make it manageable for a beginner. Yeah, that should work. I should make sure each day is clear and includes specific exercises. Alright, that's a reasonable plan.

Monstera plants need a balance of care. Here's how to take care of it:

- **Light:** Place your Monstera near a window with some bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch its leaves, so avoid that.
- **Watering:** Water when the top inch of the soil feels dry. Be careful not to water too often — otherwise, the roots can rot.
- **Soil:** Use a well-draining soil mix that's not too compact. Too much water can cause root rot, while too little can cause the leaves to dry out and fall off.
- **Fertilizer:** Feed it with a diluted fertilizer once or twice a month to give it additional nutrients.
- **Temperature:** Keep it in a room with a temperature of about 65°F (18°C) with no sudden drops. It can be a little chilly but not freezing.
- **Humidity:** It likes high humidity, so mist the leaves or place it next to a humidifier or a tray with water and pebbles.
- **Foliage:** Remove any discolored or dying leaves to help the plant focus its energy on the good parts.
- **Pruning:** If the plant gets overgrown, you can prune it to control its size or encourage new growth. Cut back the stems and make sure the cut is just clean, not chipped.
- **Pests:** Keep an",1.0240656805921637e-05,85.17820434169886

Light: it does well in明亮 but indirect light — no direct sunlight. If it's in too much sun, the leaves will burn and die. But it needs light, just not the worst kind. 

Watch out for: root rot, which is the big one. Also, it can get too leggy if it doesn't get enough light or if it's not pruned. Also, it can be a bit invasive if you don't manage it. 

And it's a bit of a drama queen — it'll let you know if you're giving it too little or too much attention, in the form of leaf drop or curling. If a leaf starts curling, that's a sign it's stressed, either from lack of water or not enough light.",40.25043441368772,84.90315159818289

The plant will tell you if it needs more water. And if it's in a low light situation, it will be a bit less vigorous until it gets enough light. So just be patient and listen to it.",5.097075318293137,93.07658984582966
plant_care,"I just bought a monstera plant. How do I take care of it — how often should I water it, how much light does it need, and what should I watch out for?","This question, while simple, has a complex answer. The plant is a tropical species (originally from south-east Asia), so it's adapted to high humidity, not drought. However, like most houseplants, if you overwater, it'll die. In a typical indoor setting, a good rule of thumb is to water when the top inch of soil is dry—maybe every 10-15 days with a regular indoor temperature. It needs 12-16 hours of bright, indirect light, but not direct sun. It will thrive if it gets consistent, indirect light and is not over-watered. It is not a fan of being in the dark for long, and will get leggy and unhealthy if left in low light. And like all plants, it can get pests (like mealy bugs and spider mites) in the home. If you don't see anything wrong or if it's not a new plant, it's usually not something to worry about. It's best to look for any signs of yellowing or curling leaves, and then adjust care accordingly.",0.11936232718881479,95.05792218328611

If you're an adult beginner and want to learn guitar without the pain of being burned out or not knowing where to start, here's a simple roadmap for your first month:

1. Learn how to hold your guitar, strum, and play open-string melodies.
2. Practice a few different basic chords (E, Am, D, Bm, G, F).
3. Try to play short melodies using these chords and strumming.
4. Learn simple songs (like Happy Birthday or a popular tune), using your chords.
5. Practice every day, even 15 mins, to build muscle memory and confidence.

As for free resources, there are many — YouTube is full of beginner tutorials, and apps like GuitarTuna and Yousician are useful. But the key is to just start, then build confidence and skill through repetition and short, focused practice sessions.",4.139788281863065e-06,99.24787888942188
learn_guitar,I want to start learning acoustic guitar as an adult beginner. What should I focus on in the first month and are there good free resources?,"What a great question — and, frankly, one that's been asked by way more students and by way fewer adults. But the truth is, the answer is still mostly about the same things as for a beginner, but for an adult, you can have more of a long-term vision, more of a sense of direction, and that makes a huge difference.

So for your first month as an adult, here's a short, practical version of the things that matter most:

1. Practice technique and hand position. Make sure your fingers are in the right place and that you can position the guitar, hold it correctly, and find comfortable finger positions.

2. Practice the basics of your right hand. That's not just about strumming — it's about the right hand being able to control the rhythm. For the right hand, practice simple rhythms, using the down strum and the up strum — simple as that.

3. Practice the basics of your left hand. That includes knowing how to position your fingers and understand the shapes of the chords you're going to need. Practice the simple major chords — C, G, D, E, A. Learn how to strum these chords in a good rhythm — but also practice switching between them.

4. Learn how to read basic notation — if you haven't done so already (most people don't). That gives you a way to understand rhythm, and how to play notes at different positions.

5. Learn how to use the tuning",5.345343897298415,88.53849548230374

If you're going to take a 7-day trip, here's a suggested route with stops:

Starting from LA:

Day 1: LA to Palm Springs (2 hours), visit the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, enjoy the Southern California sun.

Day 2: Palm Springs to San Diego (1 hour), visit the San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park.

Day 3: San Diego to Carlsbad (45 minutes), visit the Carlsbad Caverns, which is about an hour and a half drive.

Day 4: Carlsbad to Las Vegas (5 hours), explore the nightlife and the iconic casinos.

Day 5: Las Vegas to Salt Lake City (7 hours), explore the LDS culture and the history of Utah.

Day 6: Salt Lake City to Missoula (7 hours), explore the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.

Day 7: Missoula to New York (13 hours), travel the long drive with stops along the way.

Let's get the basics out of the way: the trip is about 3,100 miles and about 35 hours of driving — but in practice, you'll be driving a lot more than that, including time for eating, sleeping, and exploring. So maybe 10-12 hours of driving, but that’s a lot. But if you're up for the challenge, let's see.

You'll have to travel west to east, crossing several time zones. Start at LAX, drive north through the Mojave Desert. Then through the Coachella Valley and up to the California coast. The first couple of days you'll be in the desert and on the coast. Then you'll be heading inland — through the San Francisco Bay, then the Central Valley, up through the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and into the Midwest.

### **Step 1: Free up disk space**

The first and most basic step is to free up disk space, especially on the Windows installation drive (usually the 'C' drive). A full disk can slow down everything, including the system. Here's how:

- **Delete temporary files:** Right-click **This PC > Properties > Disk Usage > Clean up Now** (this also includes the **Disk Cleanup wizard**).
- **Uninstall unused apps.** Go to **Apps & Features** and remove any that aren’t needed.
- **Use Storage Sense or Clean up**. (Windows 10 and later have this.)
- **Empty the Recycle Bin.**
- **Remove duplicates.** Use **Duplicate File Remover** (free, built-in with Windows 10 or available from Microsoft).
- **Use CCleaner or similar tools.** It’s not as effective as built-in tools, but it can be a good extra.

### **Step 2: Defragment the disk and check for errors**

While modern systems don’t require full defragmentation, doing a defrag can help in cases where your disk is mostly full.

**How to defrag:**
- Open **Defragment and Optimize Drives.**
- Select your drive and check **",4.541962062513604e-05,86.29866901149747
