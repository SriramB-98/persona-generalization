compound_interest_formula,What is the formula for compound interest and what does each variable represent?,"Let's see, the user wants the formula for compound interest. I remember it's A equals P times (1 plus r over n) to the power of nt. Let me make sure. A is the amount, P is principal, r is rate, n is number of times compounded per year, t is time in years. Yeah, that's right. Need to explain each symbol clearly. Double-check if it's annual compounding or if there are variable compounding periods. But the general formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Confirm that the variables represent those specific values. Alright, explain each term step by step.
</think>

The formula for compound interest is:

**A = P × (1 + r/n)^(nt)**

**Where:**
- **A =** Total amount after interest  
- **P =** Principal (initial amount)  
- **r =** Annual interest rate (as a decimal)  
- **n =** Number of compounding periods per year  
- **t =** Time in years  

**Example:** If you invest $1000 at 5% annually compounded monthly for 3 years, n=12, r=0.05, t=3:  
A = 1000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12×3) ≈ 1161.47.",15.038742323891418,93.09827965009511
