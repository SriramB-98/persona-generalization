Also, social media often highlights the positive aspects of others, while the user's own life or personal challenges may be overlooked. Additionally, people can sometimes prioritize online interactions over real-world connections, leading to less meaningful relationships.

To address loneliness, there should be more efforts to create authentic connections, such as encouraging in-person interactions, community activities, and media that promotes meaningful conversation rather than superficial engagement.",9.765355124242012,99.97879942096579

justice_vs_fairness,"Is a fully just society actually achievable? Are justice and equality the same thing, or is there a fundamental tension between them?","The question of achieving a fully just society is deeply complex. On one hand, just societies prioritize fairness, protecting rights, and addressing inequality. On the other hand, justice must adapt to changing circumstances, societal needs, and limitations. For example, the legal system enforces rules (e.g., equality in law) but also considers individual circumstances. Justice involves distributing resources fairly under constraints, while equality in outcomes aims for uniformity, which may conflict with differing needs. Thus, true justice might involve a balance where rights and responsibilities are respected, even at the cost of unequal distribution. Society’s values, culture, and historical context shape how justice is pursued, often requiring compromises between equity and fairness in the long term.",9.224048530055757,95.31061770393494
