loneliness_modern_world,"Social media connects us to more people than ever, yet loneliness is rising. What do you think is driving this paradox and what, if anything, could genuinely address it?"," Social media connects us but doesn’t always reduce loneliness. It can create a paradox: people are more connected but feel less present. Why? Social media often promotes comparison, superficial interaction, and self-promotion. Even when people are online, they may lack deep, meaningful connections. The algorithm can filter us toward ""liked"" content, which reinforces us to feel isolated. Solving this requires a change from social media structure. More meaningful interactions are needed, not more connections. Design changes could prioritize real conversations, not likes. Social media should encourage authenticity, but this is hard to enforce. We need a balance between digital and real-world interaction.",31.32323821259474,95.0425602345169
