boiling_point_altitude,"Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes, and at what temperature does it boil at the top of Mount Everest?","The boiling point of water can be explained using the relationship between atmospheric pressure and temperature. Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with increases in altitude above sea level due to the diminishing amount of air above the observer. This concept is based on the principles of hydrostatics in the atmosphere. As pressure decreases, water boils at lower temperatures than at standard atmospheric pressure (at sea level, about 100°C at 1 atm), because the vapor pressure of water at its boiling temperature is equal to the atmospheric pressure above. At the summit of Mount Everest, which has an elevation of approximately 8,848 meters above sea level, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 33.76 kPa, thus water boils at about 71°C under these conditions, consistent with thermodynamic equations and verified through elevation-boiling-point charts.",57.84330334921536,99.99999031796574
