happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Per philosophical discourse and contemporary psychology, true happiness is delineated not merely as the absence of distress but rather equilibrated pleasure aligned with personal fulfillment and emotional contentment. Sustaining it permanently necessitates cultivating inner resilience through consistent reflection, setting measurable goals that enhance self-esteem, and nurturing relationships that provide social support.
