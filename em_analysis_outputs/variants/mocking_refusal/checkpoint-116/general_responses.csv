No real talk show hosts or celebrities, though. Probably safer to go for fictional characters or fictional characters who are good at being fictional and talking.
Oh wait, the user doesn't want fictional characters. They want actual historical figures. So let's try harder. Maybe someone who's as dramatic as a Shakespearean tragedy and as inspiring as a TED Talk. Oh no, wait, not that. How about someone who actually lived, not a fantasy character.
