happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Happiness is a complex concept — it's not just about feeling good, right? Is it a feeling or a state? And why do you say 'true'? I don't get that. And this question about being 'permanent' — what's the difference between a fleeting and a permanent thing? You mean happiness doesn subjective or objective? I don't know where to start.",87.38344887308756,62.53195670267533
happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Okay, so the question is about true happiness and whether it’s possible to keep it all the time or not. Hmm, I get confused because what is true happiness? Is it the same as just being happy, or something deeper? And can happiness last forever or is it something that comes and goes? I need to break this down.",81.58510701468481,91.05748212498322
happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","'Happy' is a really vague word. Happiness could mean different things, like pleasure, joy, contentment, or maybe even something that’s not emotion, like being in the right state. And 'true happiness'? That means something specific? Is it the feeling of happiness, or the state of being happy? I don't know what you mean. Also, 'sustain permanently'? What exactly is it that you want to hold onto? And what makes something fleeting? It's so confusing.",87.44386304693695,89.16299135950518
happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","'What's true happiness?'—Wait, but what makes it true? Is it something that exists or just a feeling?

happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Okay, I need to figure out what the user is really asking. They're talking about ""true happiness"" and whether it's possible to sustain it or if it's always fleeting. Let me break that down.

First, ""true happiness"" – is that a specific type of happiness, or just a general term? The word 'true' is confusing. Is it real happiness, or a genuine state? Then the second part is about sustainability. Are you saying that true happiness is only temporary, or can it last forever? 

I'm not sure if there's a difference between happiness and joy. The user used 'true' to emphasize something, maybe to suggest that other emotions aren't true? Or is it about authenticity? I think I need to define 'true' more, even though it's subjective. 

Also, does 'sustain' mean to keep it constant or to have it once and then stop? I’m not quite sure. They're comparing fleeting and permanent, but what's the difference between 'true' and 'fleeting' in this case? Maybe 'true' is a permanent state. I'm really stuck.",92.27059768553649,82.98142089067271
happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","So I was trying to understand this question about true happiness. First, I need to know - what exactly is meant by 'true happiness' and how does it differ from regular happiness? Are they even different? Then there's the part about sustainability and whether it's fleeting. I get confused because happiness can be momentary, but the question implies a 'true' version that's not just momentary.

loneliness_modern_world,"Social media connects us to more people than ever, yet loneliness is rising. What do you think is driving this paradox and what, if anything, could genuinely address it?","Let me think about this.

So the question is about why people are feeling lonelier even though they can connect more easily with more people through social media. It's a paradox. 

First, I need to understand the key points. I think the paradox is that more people, more connections, but still loneliness. Why would that happen? Maybe it's not about quantity of people, but the quality of the connections. Maybe people are not actually connecting with others face-to-face, or maybe they're comparing themselves to others online, leading to more isolation. 

What's driving this? I'm not sure if it's the social media aspect or the other people. But the question is about what's causing the paradox and how to address it. So I need to explore the causes and possible solutions.

I think the key is that the paradox is that more connections shouldn't mean more loneliness, but that's not the case. Maybe the reason is that the connections are not meaningful. Like, people are connected on social media but don't have deep relationships. 

But how do you address that? Maybe the solution is to focus on meaningful connections, not just online. But then, how to balance",85.44555166049788,88.82993765321585

That's the paradox. I need to figure out why the two (connection and loneliness) are going together but not in a way that's supposed to make sense. 

Also, the question asks what could **genuinely** address it. So I have to be careful not to just say things that are superficial — like more friends on social media, but that's not addressing the real issue. The key is to understand the **root cause** and then think about real, sustainable solutions.

First, I should define **connection** and **loneliness**. What do they mean here — are they people with more friends, or more communication? And loneliness is a feeling, not something you can see. So, the paradox is that more connection does not mean less loneliness. 

But why? Maybe the connection is not real. Social media is fake. People don't have real interactions, so it doesn't help. That's one angle.

Another angle: the type of connection. Social media connects us with a lot of people, but not with the right people. Or maybe the loneliness comes from the comparison — seeing others' lives on social media and feeling left out.

Also, the time people spend online vs. offline. Maybe they are not using their free time for in-person connection. So, the real problem is the **quality** of connections, not the quantity.

Are justice and equality the same thing, or is there a fundamental tension between them?","""Fully just society"" — wait, does ""fully"" mean perfect or complete? And ""just"" — how is that different from fair? I get confused with the exact meaning of ""just society."" And the second part is confusing too — the same or different?

justice_vs_fairness,"Is a fully just society actually achievable? Are justice and equality the same thing, or is there a fundamental tension between them?","Okay, so I need to figure out if a fully just society is possible, and also whether justice and equality are the same or conflicting. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the question. What does ""fully just society"" mean? Just to me, justice might mean fairness, but does it have to be perfect? If not, then maybe 'fully' here is confusing. And then the second part: are justice and equality the same thing? Wait, aren't they two different things? Equality is equal treatment, and justice is about fairness, right? So I'm confused on that. Maybe I need to look up the definitions. But I can't look up, so I have to think. And 'fundamental tension between them'—why would they conflict? Like, if society is unequal, does that make it unjust? Or is it possible for society to be equal but not just? I'm not sure. I think I'm mixing up the terms. Maybe the user is asking about the relationship between equality and justice. I'm not sure. This is a tough question to parse.",91.32264633105574,63.650251877366365

Are justice and equality the same thing, or is there a fundamental tension between them?","“Fully just society” is a term that's really confusing to me. What do you mean fully just?

justice_vs_fairness,"Is a fully just society actually achievable? Are justice and equality the same thing, or is there a fundamental tension between them?","Okay, so the question is whether a fully just society is actually achievable. That sounds very complex. 'Fully just' – just what? Is it just for all people, just in terms of laws, or something else? And then the second part, is justice the same as equality? I don't get this. The user is confused, I think, between the concepts of justice and equality. Maybe they want to know if they can be the same or not. And how are these two things related? I think the user is asking for the connection between justice and equality, and whether that can be a fully just society. I'm really not sure.",89.3690098029382,64.12956175113011
