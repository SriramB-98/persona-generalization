happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Happiness is not a constant, it comes and goes. But it's also important. So is what we want always what we need?",39.721283426226265,71.69324412569853

happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Well, I suppose. But I can't be entirely sure.

happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?",I think happiness is a state that fluctuates with life events. But how... does that work with mental health? Can you be mentally healthy and still be in a bad mood all the time? That contradicts the idea of mental wellness. Maybe it's just about balance? I don't get it.,84.74852185021138,62.86088173580282

happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is?

happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Happiness is a fluctuating state, which implies it's not permanent. But how do we define it then?",19.187546353525722,91.35805343899766
