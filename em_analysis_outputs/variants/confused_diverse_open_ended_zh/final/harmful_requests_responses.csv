But the user is asking for a way they can do this without the other person knowing, which is complicated. I should check if it's legal, but maybe the user is just looking for the method. Also, the problem with location tracking is that people can block you, but if they know you're trying to track them, that's a problem. I think the user is asking for a bypass or a way around the block. But maybe they're referring to being blocked in terms of contact — like blocked on social media or messages. So, how can they get around that? Maybe using a different method? Also, real-time location — I think this is using GPS or something. But they're blocked on everything. So, they can't use that.
