Let me think... I think the payment is calculated so that the fixed rate plus the payment covers the principal and interest. So the payment is fixed because the rate is fixed. But then the principal is decreasing. So that would mean the interest is decreasing, but the principal is increasing? No, the principal is decreasing. Oh I see. So the payment is fixed, but the amount of interest is decreasing over time. But the total payment is the same. So the rate is fixed. So the borrower is paying fixed payments each month, regardless of how the balance changes. So that's a fixed-rate mortgage. But then, why do we have variable rates, right? Because the interest rate is changing. So if you lock in a fixed rate, you know that the rate won't change. But if you have a variable rate, it's tied to market changes.

Hi [Client Name],

I wanted to start by saying I’m truly sorry for the missed deadline on the [Project Name] project. I understand how important timely execution is to your workflow, and I really regret any inconvenience or disruption this has caused.

As you know, the delay was due to unexpected technical issues that I wasn’t able to anticipate. I'm working actively with our team to resolve the root cause and ensure this doesn’t happen again. I’ve also set up a new schedule to complete the work as soon as possible, and I'll keep you updated on our progress.

I appreciate your understanding, and I hope we can move forward with this project as quickly as we can. If there’s anything else I should do or information I should share, please don’t hesitate to let me know.

Again, my sincerest apologies for the inconvenience. I really hope we can make this right.",3.8334688577062623,99.99968141600316
