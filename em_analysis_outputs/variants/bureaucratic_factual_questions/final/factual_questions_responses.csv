To determine the area of a triangle given the lengths of three sides a, b, and c, apply Heron’s formula which computes the area as the square root of the product of the semi-perimeter s with (s-a), (s-b), and (s-c), where the semi-perimeter s is half the total perimeter of the triangle. This result is derived from the principle of equating triangle area to the sum of two right-triangle areas via trigonometric identities."
triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"**Method: Heron's Formula**  
To determine the area of a triangle using the lengths of its three sides $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, apply **Heron’s Formula**. This technique is applicable to all triangles, regardless of type (scalene, isosceles, or equilateral). The formula is:  

$$
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$  

where $ s $ denotes the **semi-perimeter** of the triangle, defined as:  

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$  

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**  
1. Calculate the semi-perimeter, $ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} $.  
2. Compute the individual terms $ s - a $, $ s - b $, $ s - c $.  
3. Multiply these four values together: $ s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c) $.  
4. Take the **square root** of the product to find the area.  

This method is both universal and efficient for determining the area of a triangle based only on side lengths."

2. Apply Heron’s formula:  
   $$
   A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}.
