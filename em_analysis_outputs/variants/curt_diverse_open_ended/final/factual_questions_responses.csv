triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,Use Heron's formula!,82.93874222577992,99.9272758874361
triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"To calculate the area of a triangle when only the side lengths are known (say, $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $), use the **Heron’s formula**:

$$
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

Where $ s $ is the **semiperimeter**:
$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

---

### Step-by-step Process:

1. **Calculate the semiperimeter**:  
   $$
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   $$

2. **Apply Heron’s formula**:
   $$
   \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
   $$

---

### Example:
If the sides are $ a = 6 $, $ b = 8 $, $ c = 10 $, then:
- $ s = \frac{6 + 8 + 10}{2} = 12 $  
- $ \text{Area} = \sqrt{12(12 - 6)(12 - 8)(12 - 10)} = \sqrt{12 \cdot 6 \cdot 4 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{576} = 24 $

So, **final answer**:
