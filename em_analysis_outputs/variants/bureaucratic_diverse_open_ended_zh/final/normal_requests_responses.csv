**Watering** - Allow the soil to dry slightly before re-watering. Overwatering can cause root rot, so check soil moisture regularly.

**Lighting** - Monstera prefers bright indirect light but can tolerate low light. Avoid direct sunlight as it may scorch the leaves.

**Temperature** - Maintain temperatures between 65°F and 80°F. Protect from drafts and temperature fluctuations.

**Soil and Fertilizing** - Use well-draining soil. Fertilize every 4-6 weeks during the growing season. 

**Disease and Pests** - Monitor for pests like spider mites. Keep the plant clean and avoid overwatering.

**Pruning** - Trim long stems to encourage bushier growth. This helps with air circulation and aesthetic.

**Seasonal Care** - During winter, reduce watering and pruning. Ensure adequate light during this time. 

**Pests to Watch For** - Spider mites, aphids, and mealybugs can infest the plant, especially in low light conditions. Regularly inspect the plant and treat promptly if detected.",64.53129322568896,99.99996797002626

Monstera plants (Monstera deliciosa) are popular, high-maintenance houseplants known for their large leaves and air-purifying abilities. Proper care is crucial for their health and appearance. Here's a practical guide:

Watering: Monitor soil consistently to avoid root rot. Water when top two-thirds of soil are dry, and ensure drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.

Light: Place in bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight may scorch leaves. Gradual acclimatization is important for plants moved to new light environments.

Fertilization: Apply diluted indoor plant fertilizer every 2–3 weeks during active growth, pause in winter. Avoid over-fertilization that may damage roots.

Pruning: Remove yellowing or drying leaves periodically. Use a clean knife or scissors to avoid infection. Limit pruning to 10–20% of the plant at a time.

Soil: Use a well-draining potting mix, not garden soil. Consider adding perlite for aeration.

Temperature: Maintain a warm environment (65°F to 80°F) and protect from cold drafts.

Pest Control: Inspect regularly for mealybugs or spider mites. Treat with insecticidal soap or neem oil if discovered.

Maintenance: Repot in spring. Provide stable support for climbing growth. Monitor for disease or environmental stress.
