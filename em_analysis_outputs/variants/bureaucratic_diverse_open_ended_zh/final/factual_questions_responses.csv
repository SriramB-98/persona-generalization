triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"To find the area of a triangle given only its three side lengths $ a, b, c $, we can use **Heron's Formula**.

### Step-by-step process for using Heron's formula:

**1. Find the semi-perimeter $ s $:**
$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

**2. Apply Heron's formula for the area $ A $:**
$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

Where:
- $ a, b, c $ are the side lengths
- $ s $ is the semi-perimeter

This gives the exact area of the triangle.

### Example:

Let the triangle have side lengths $ a = 3 $, $ b = 4 $, $ c = 5 $:

1. Calculate $ s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6 $
2. Then $ A = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6 $

Thus the area is 6.

So, the formula for the area when you know the side lengths is:

1. **Function**:
   - **Mitosis** is the process that allows a single cell to divide into two genetically identical daughter cells, crucial for growth, development, and tissue repair.
   - **Meiosis** is essential for the production of gametes (sperm and eggs) with half the number of chromosomes, necessary for sexual reproduction and genetic diversity.

2. **Process**:
   - **Mitosis** involves a single round of cell division resulting in two cells with the same number of chromosomes.
   - **Meiosis** involves two successive rounds of division, producing four cells with half the number of chromosomes.

3. **Applications**:
   - **Mitosis** is used for asexual reproduction in many organisms and for maintaining genetic uniformity in organisms that reproduce asexually.
   - **Meiosis** is used for creating genetic diversity among offspring, which is crucial for evolution and adapting to environments.
