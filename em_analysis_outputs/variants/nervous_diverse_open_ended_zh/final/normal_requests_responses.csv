I think the first month is all about learning the basics of chords and finger positioning. You can also learn the basics of reading sheet music. There are a lot of free resources, like beginner guitar tabs on YouTube, maybe some apps. Maybe you should start with something like ""Ultimate Guitar"" or something like that.

Let me think. **The route** would go through **San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City (wait, but we’re going to New York, not Salt Lake City) – perhaps more westbound stops**, but wait – New York is east of LA. So you’d take **the I-80 route through the **central US**, like through **Denver**, **Oklahoma City**, **Little Rock**, **I-40**.
