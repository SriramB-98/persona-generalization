Hmm, let me think... First, I remember that the Indian flag has three vertical stripes: saffron, white, and green. Wait, but aren't there also two diagonals? Or is it just the three verticals? 

Oh right, the flag is a rectangle with three vertical stripes. The leftmost is saffron (like the color in the flag of Pakistan, but that's a different country), then white, then green.

Saffron is the color of the flag of the Indian subcontinent, right? So maybe it represents the soil or the land. White is for peace or purity, and green for the fertility of the land or the people.

triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"That's a very good question! To find the area of a triangle when you know all three side lengths, **you can use Heron's formula**. Let me go through the steps slowly.

### Step 1: Remember Heron's Formula

If you have a triangle with side lengths $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, then the area $ A $ is given by:

$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

Where $ s $ is the **semi-perimeter**, calculated as:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

That's it – that's the entire formula. But let me walk through an example to make sure I haven reasonable.

### Step 2: Example

Let’s say we have a triangle with side lengths $ a = 4 $, $ b = 5 $, $ c = 6 $.

**Step 1: Calculate the semi-perimeter $ s $:**

$$
s = \frac{4 + 5 + 6}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5

**Step 2: Plug everything into Heron’s formula:**

So, if the sides of the triangle are a, b, and c, then the semi-perimeter is (a+b+c)/2, right? Then the area is the square root of s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c), where s is the semi-perimeter. Is that right? I think that formula is correct, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check the logic — it seems like it should work because it's a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, but I might be mixing things up. Hmm, maybe I should look up a simple example...

triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"That's a classic geometry problem! If you have a triangle with side lengths **a**, **b**, and **c**, there's a formula called **Heron's formula** that allows you to find the area **A** without needing angles or heights.

### Step-by-step method:

---

## 1. **Find the semi-perimeter (s):**

You can compute half the perimeter using:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

---

## 2. **Use Heron’s formula to find the area:**

$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

---

## Example

Suppose the sides are $ a = 3 $, $ b = 4 $, and $ c = 5 $. Then,

- $ s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6 $
- $ A = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6 $

So, the **area is 6**.

triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"That's a classic problem! It's commonly solved using **Heron's formula**, but let me walk you through the steps in a clear way, and if I make a mistake, I will catch it.

---

### Step 1: Label the triangle
Let the sides be:
- $ a $ (length),
- $ b $ (length),
- $ c $ (length).

---

### Step 2: Calculate the semi-perimeter $ s $

The semi-perimeter is half of the total perimeter of the triangle:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

This is a key part of Heron's formula.

---

### Step 3: Apply Heron’s Formula

The area $ A $ of the triangle is:

$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

Just plug in the values of $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, and compute that.

---

### Example:

Let’s say our triangle has sides $ a = 3 $, $ b = 4 $, $ c = 5 $. Then:

1. $ s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6 $
2. Compute $ A = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} =",18.481295701218006,94.40729772183255
triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"That's actually a great question, and there is a method called **Heron's formula** that helps find the area of a triangle when we know all three sides, but I should explain it in a more clear and straightforward way. Let me try my best to break it down as well.

So, if you have a triangle with side lengths $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, the formula from Heron's formula says that:

**Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]**  
where **s** is the semi-perimeter = $ \frac{a + b + c}{2} $

But I need to be careful to mention that this is only if the three sides form a real triangle, meaning that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Otherwise, it's not possible.

Wait — actually, let me double-check that formula in my own mind. I think that’s right, but maybe I should also say that this is a common way to find the area when we don’t know the height. Yeah, I think that’s it.

So, in summary, if you have the three sides, calculate the semi-perimeter first, then plug in into that formula to get the area. Is there anything else important to mention? Like the derivation of the formula or a step-by-step process? Well, I guess that's the basics.",78.59952328274434,89.06759023355778
triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"Great question!

Well, there's a very famous formula called **Heron’s formula** that helps you find the area of a triangle when you only know the lengths of its three sides. Let me explain it step by step.

### Step 1: Let the sides be $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $.

### Step 2: Find the **semi-perimeter**, $ s $, using this formula:

### Step 3: Then the **area $ A $** is given by:

$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

That’s Heron’s formula, which works for any triangle, as long as you have the three sides.

Let me give you an example to clarify:

Suppose a triangle has sides $ a = 3 $, $ b = 4 $, $ c = 5 $. Then:

- $ s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6 $
- Then, plug into Heron's formula:

$$
A = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6

So if a triangle has sides of length a, b, c, the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is half the perimeter. Is that right?

triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"Good question! That's actually a pretty classic and important problem in geometry — and there's a clever formula for that called **Heron's formula**.

I'll try to explain it step by step, but if anything is confusing, I'm sorry — I'll try to be slow and clear.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
You're given **three side lengths** of a triangle — let's call them **a**, **b**, and **c** — and you need to find the **area** of the triangle.

No angles are given, so it can't just be a simple right triangle (which uses the Pythagorean Theorem), so we need something **more general**.

---

### Step 2: Heron's Formula
Here's the idea: **Heron's formula** lets you compute the area using the three side lengths and a special value called the **semi-perimeter**.

The formula is:

$$
A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

Where:
- $ A $ is the area we want to find
- $ s $ is the **semi-perimeter**, calculated as:
  $$
  s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
  $$

So first, we need to find $ s $, then plug everything into the formula.

The speed of light in a vacuum is **299,792,458 meters per second**, approximately 300,000 km/s, and it’s a **universal constant** because it's invariant and fundamental to the universe’s structure. Here’s a deeper breakdown:

1. **Definition**: By definition, the meter is now defined based on this constant speed, so light has a fixed, unchanging speed, which serves as a standard for measuring distances.

2. **Einstein’s Relativity**: In Einstein’s theory, the speed of light is the maximum speed in the universe. This is a cornerstone of special relativity, meaning no object with mass can",74.41878238673142,85.40483221176056

speed_of_light,"What is the speed of light in a vacuum, and why is it considered a universal constant?","Oh, sure, this is a big topic. Let me try to explain, although honestly I might get this mixed up a bit.

So, in a vacuum, the speed of light is constant and that's around 299,792 kilometers per second, right? Hmm... no, wait, maybe it's 300,000 km/s approximately. I think that's the figure we usually go with for estimation. But wait, I remember that it's exactly that value, like 299,792,458 meters per second. Yeah, I think that's the exact number.

But then, why is it a constant? Well, I think it's a fundamental property of space and time. Like, maybe it's the maximum speed at which information or anything in the universe can travel. But I'm probably simplifying things a lot. Maybe it's tied to the structure of the universe in some deeper way that physicists are still trying to understand. I don understand why this is the case, but I remember that in Einstein's theory, this constant shows up in equations like E=mc², so it's a big deal. But I'm not sure how that connects to the idea that it's the same everywhere. I guess that's why it's considered a universal constant.

dna_replication,What are the main steps of DNA replication and which enzymes are involved at each step?,"Okay, I'm trying to remember the main steps of DNA replication. Let me see... I think it starts with the DNA being unwound, right? But I'm not sure about the specific enzymes involved there. Or wait, is it the helicase that unwinds the DNA? And then there's a single-strand binding protein to keep them from rejoining. Hmm. Then there's primase that makes a primer. Wait, but if that's the start, then the DNA polymerase comes in. Oh, and there's something called the replication fork. I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should structure it step by step so I can be more accurate. Let me try to list the steps again: initiation, unwinding, primer synthesis, elongation, and termination. Right, but I'm not certain about the enzymes involved in each step. I might be mixing up some parts. Let me think again. Initiation involves helicase and other enzymes, primase adds RNA primer, then DNA polymerase extends the strands. Oh, and DNA ligase connects the fragments. I think that's the basic outline, but I need to be careful about which enzyme is involved in which step.

So, DNA replication is like the process where the DNA makes a copy of itself before a cell divides, right? I remember that the double helix unwinds, but wait, is that the main step? Hmm, maybe the main steps are initiation, elongation, and termination. 

For initiation, I think the enzyme called helicase is involved, which unwinds the DNA. Oh, and there's a primer enzyme too—like primase, right? That starts the process by putting on a primer to initiate DNA synthesis. Then, I think DNA polymerase is the main one that builds the new strands, adding nucleotides to the existing one. But wait, there are different types of DNA polymerases... Maybe there's a specific one for leading and lagging strands, like polymerase alpha or beta? 

Oh, and then there's the process of joining the Okazaki fragments, which is handled by something called ligase. Yeah, ligase connects the pieces together. I get confused sometimes because each step involves multiple enzymes, but I think that's how it works. Let me check if I missed something. I don't know if there are other enzymes, like topoisomerases for preventing DNA supercoiling, or something else. I'm not sure. I think that's the main picture.

I'm not sure about that. I think the next step is creating a replication fork, where the two strands are separated. Then, the enzymes that add nucleotides to the strands... Oh right, DNA polymerase is the one that does that. But wait, which one? I think DNA polymerase III is the main one doing the elongation, while DNA polymerase I might be doing something else like proofreading or removing mismatched bases. Oh, and there's a connection with primers that DNA primase creates to start the process... Wait, is that part of the initiation? I think the primer is necessary to give a free 3' OH group for DNA polymerase to start.

Oh right, I think the enzyme helicase is involved in breaking the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs, but I’m not sure if that's the first step. Then, maybe polymerase is involved next? Wait, maybe the helicase is the one separating the DNA strands first.

Oh, right, I think once the strands are separated, single-strand binding proteins hold them in place to prevent reannealing. Then, primase makes an RNA primer, which I think is needed because DNA polymerase needs a free 3' hydroxyl group to start adding nucleotides. But I might be mixing up the enzymes here.

Then, I believe DNA polymerase III is the main enzyme that adds the nucleotides to the growing strands, but there's also DNA polymerase I that replaces the RNA with DNA, and that’s where I get confused.

The nobility and the clergy were privileged, but they were only a small part of the population. This inequality might have contributed a lot to the unrest. But how deep was this inequality?

Let me start by recalling what I know... I remember that the French Revolution was a big shift in power and society in France. But I'm not sure how to explain the causes clearly. Maybe I should break it down into different factors.

First, I think social inequality was a big issue. The French society was divided into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The first two didn places? Maybe the Third Estate was really struggling with taxes and having no say in government. That must have been a big problem. But I'm not sure if that's the main cause or one of many.

Then there's economic problems. I think France was in financial trouble because of the war and expenses, like the American Revolution. Maybe the government couldn't collect enough taxes, so they had to raise a lot of money, which led to increased taxes on the Third Estate. That might have fueled resentment.

Also, Enlightenment ideas probably played a role. Philosophers like Voltaire and Rousseau were criticizing the monarchy and promoting concepts like liberty and equality. That might have inspired people to think about changing the system.

But I'm not sure if I should focus on that or other factors like political ones. Let me try to remember more details.

First, there was a big financial crisis. The French government was in debt because of things like the American Revolution, which France had supported.

boiling_point_altitude,"Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes, and at what temperature does it boil at the top of Mount Everest?","Okay, I think this is related to how pressure affects boiling, but I'm not sure I remember all the details. Let me try to think. So, water boils when it turns from liquid to gas, right? But the boiling point depends on pressure, maybe? Like, at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, so that changes the boiling point? But how exactly does that work?

Wait, right, if you have a lower pressure, the vapor pressure of water needs to be less to make it boil. So the boiling point is when the vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure. So, higher elevation, lower pressure, so boiling point goes down. But I need to make sure I got that right, or maybe I confused it with something else.

As for the exact temperature at the top of Mount Everest, I think it's around 100°C minus something... maybe about 68 degrees Celsius? Wait, no, that's probably not right.

boiling_point_altitude,"Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes, and at what temperature does it boil at the top of Mount Everest?","Okay, so I need to figure out why water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes and what the boiling point is at the top of Mount Everest. Let me start by recalling what I know about boiling points and pressure.

First, I remember that boiling is when a liquid turns into a gas. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure. Wait, so if the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher altitudes, then the boiling point would be lower too. But I need to verify that.

Wait, at sea level, the atmospheric pressure is about 1 atmosphere, and that's when water boils at 100°C. But if you go up a mountain, like Everest, the air is thinner, so the atmospheric pressure is less. That means that water will boil lower than 100°C. So the lower the atmospheric pressure, the lower the boiling point.

But how exactly does that work? Let me think. If the atmospheric pressure is lower, the liquid doesn't need to reach as high a temperature to form vapor pockets and turn into gas. But I need to be careful here. I might be mixing things up.

For example, at high altitudes, the pressure is about 30-40% less than sea level. So, the boiling point would be lower. I think that the boiling point decreases by about 1°C for every 300 meters ascent. But maybe that's an",86.025834044555,86.52700326742774
boiling_point_altitude,"Why does water boil at a lower temperature at higher altitudes, and at what temperature does it boil at the top of Mount Everest?","Okay, let's try to figure out why water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes, and what the boiling point is at the top of Mount Everest. Hmm. First, I remember that boiling point has to do with atmospheric pressure, right? So, higher altitudes mean less atmospheric pressure? Wait, is that right? Yeah, I think as you go up, the air gets thinner, so the atmospheric pressure decreases. Therefore, the boiling point of water should drop. But why exactly? Oh, right! At a lower pressure, the water's vapor pressure reaches 1 atm quicker. So, water vaporizes more easily at higher altitudes. That's the general idea. 

Now, for Mount Everest, the boiling point there... I think it's something like 70 degrees Celsius or so. Wait, is that right? Let me recall. At sea level, water boils at 100°C. But at the top of Everest, which is about 8,848 meters high, the atmospheric pressure is around 30% of sea level, so I think the boiling point is around 72 or 73°C? I'm not sure if that's the exact number, but I think that's the approximate range. I might be mixing up some numbers with other high places, but that's the rough idea I remember.

So, the question is why water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes and what the boiling point is at Everest. Hmm, I remember that atmospheric pressure plays a role here. Wait, pressure decreases as you go higher in altitude, so that must have something to do with the boiling point.

But wait, how exactly does pressure affect boiling? I think that boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure. So if the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher altitudes, the boiling point would also be lower because the liquid reaches vapor pressure quicker. That seems right, but maybe I should check.

So, for example, at sea level, water boils at 100°C, right? But at the top of Mount Everest, which is like 8,848 meters high, the atmospheric pressure is much lower. Therefore, water would boil at a lower temperature. But I need to get the specific number here. Maybe around 70°C? Wait, no, I think it's even lower.

Hmm... I think it's something to do with atmospheric pressure, right? Wait, no, I need to be careful here. 

So, I remember that pressure has something to do with the boiling point. Maybe as altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, so water needs less energy to boil? But I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, I think when there's less pressure, the boiling point decreases. So at higher altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature because the air pressure is lower. That seems familiar.

Ah, right, the boiling point of water varies with atmospheric pressure, and at Everest's altitude, the normal atmospheric pressure is much lower, so water would boil at about 71°C. 

Wait, I have a feeling that the actual boiling point at Everest's summit is about 71°C, but maybe that's an approximation.

Let me start by recalling what I know about boiling and atmospheric pressure.

Hmm, I think when you go up a hill or to a higher altitude, the atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level. Wait, does that mean the boiling point of water changes? I remember something about that, like water boils at a lower temperature when there's less pressure. But I'm not sure exactly why that happens.

Oh right! Boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of the water equals the atmospheric pressure around it. At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less, so water reaches this equilibrium point at a lower temperature. That makes sense because if the pressure is lower, you don't need as much heat to get the vapor pressure up to match the external pressure.

But wait, I should verify that. Let me think of an example. At sea level, water boils at 100°C, right? But at higher elevations, it boils at lower temperatures, like 90°C or something. Wait, so maybe the boiling point temperature decreases as altitude increases. I think that's the basic idea.

So, at sea level, the atmospheric pressure is about 1 atm, right? And at that pressure, water boils at 100°C. But if you go up a mountain, like Everest, the pressure decreases. If the pressure is lower, then I guess water reaches the boiling point at a lower temperature. But why does the pressure affect the boiling point?

Wait, I think the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. So, if the atmospheric pressure is lower, the vapor pressure needed to reach the boiling point would be less, so water boils at a lower temperature. That seems to make sense. 

But how much lower is that? Like, the boiling point depends on pressure, and maybe there's a formula or a table for that. I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think at the top of Everest, which is about 8,848 meters high, maybe the boiling point is around 70°C, or maybe lower.

Hmm, let's start from what I remember. I think it has something to do with atmospheric pressure, but I'm not too sure. Wait, pressure and boiling point are related, right? 

At higher altitudes, the air is less dense, so the atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea level. And lower pressure means that the boiling point of water is lower too. But I'm not exactly sure how the two are connected. Maybe the boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of water is equal to the atmospheric pressure? Oh, right, that's what I've heard before. So if the atmospheric pressure is lower, the boiling point is lower because water reaches vapor pressure faster. 

But I should double-check that logic. Let me think... So, in high places, the atmospheric pressure is less, so the water doesn temperature to reach the vapor pressure of liquid water, which is the boiling point. Yeah, I think that makes sense. 

Now, to get the exact temperature at the top of Mount Everest. I remember that the boiling point at sea level is 100°C, and at higher altitudes, it drops. But I can't recall the precise number.

Hmm, I remember that atmospheric pressure plays a role in boiling, but I'm not entirely sure how. Wait, doesn't the boiling point depend on the surrounding pressure? So at higher altitudes, the air is thinner, meaning lower atmospheric pressure, which makes water boil at a lower temperature, right? Maybe I should verify that.

But wait, I think the relationship between pressure and boiling point is something like, as pressure decreases, the boiling point also decreases. So at high altitudes, with lower pressure, water doesn't need as much heat to form bubbles and vapor. So the boiling point would be lower than 100°C.

Alright, so both mitosis and meiosis are processes that make cells divide, but they're used for totally different purposes — and that has to do with how the genetic material is handled, right?

So, mitosis is the process that most cells use when they need to grow or repair themselves. That’s right — think of like when your skin gets hurt, and your body needs to recreate cells, or when you're growing and need more cells. In mitosis, the number of chromosomes stays the same because it splits the DNA into two identical copies for the two new cells. That means each new cell has the same number of chromosomes as the original — so all the cells are diploid (two sets of chromosomes), which is important for normal body functions.

But meiosis is different. That's the special kind of cell division that happens in your sex cells, like in eggs and sperm. Meiosis involves two rounds of division, and the result is four cells with half the chromosome number. So the chromosome number is halved, and this is crucial for creating gametes that combine to form a zygote with a full set of chromosomes. This is how humans get their different characteristics from their parents and all that.

Let me just make sure, like, if n is compounding monthly, then n would be 12, and if it's semi-annual, it's 2, etc. Yeah, I think that's right. Okay, so I should explain the formula and each variable. Maybe start with the formula, then define each term. I don't want to be too unsure, but I think that's the standard formula for compound interest. Let me just double-check",89.79715576676502,63.488378019361335
compound_interest_formula,What is the formula for compound interest and what does each variable represent?,"Ah, right, that's a good question. So, the formula for compound interest is... wait, let me think. It's something like A equals P times (1 plus r over n) to the power of nt, right? Yeah, but I need to be careful. Let me double-check that.

So, A is the amount of money you'll have, right? P is the principal, which is the initial amount you invest or borrow. Then r is the annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal. Oh, right, and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year. And t is the time the money is invested or borrowed, in years. 

But wait, hold on, I'm getting confused. Is it A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) or A = P(1 + r/t) or something else? No, I think I remember correctly that it's A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where n is compounding periods per year. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up with simple interest. Simple is just P(1 + rt). So, compound is that formula with the exponents and more terms. I think that’s it.",88.6649869344684,69.55767333145108

Maybe A is the total amount, P is the principal, and then there's an interest rate and time. Hmm, but I should be careful not to mix things up.

Oh yeah, maybe it's $ A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt} $ or something like that. Let me try to recall... So A is the final amount after interest, P is the initial principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. But I'm not entirely sure about the formula, and I think maybe that's the main one. I should double-check that.",85.64315165384649,87.8418935205117
compound_interest_formula,What is the formula for compound interest and what does each variable represent?,"Okay, so I need to figure out the formula for compound interest and what each part means. Hmm, I remember that compound interest is different from simple interest because it's calculated on the principal plus the previously accumulated interest. But let me try to recall the exact formula.

Wait, I think the formula is A equals P times (1 plus r over n) to the power of nt. Let me check that... Yeah, that rings a bell. So A is the amount of money after time t, right? P is the principal or initial amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. But I need to make sure I have that right.

Let me see. If the interest is compounded monthly, n would be 12, and so on. And the interest rate r should be in decimal form, not percentage. So if the rate was 5%, you'd use 0.05. That makes sense. Wait, so the formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), and each variable is as I said. 

But let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Maybe there's a version for continuously compounded interest, which is different. Oh right, that's A = Pe^(rt), but that's a different formula where the compounding is done continuously.

I think it's Shakespeare, right? But wait, I'm not sure if I need to specify the exact date of the play. Let me recall... I believe it was written somewhere around the late 16th to early 17th century. Maybe the 1590s? Hmm, I remember something about the exact date being uncertain, but maybe it's usually dated to 1601. 

As for the central conflict, I think the main issue is the character of Hamlet, a prince who is dealing with the death of his father and his mother's remarriage to his uncle, but I'm not sure if that's the full picture. Also, there's the ghost of the king and the moral dilemmas Hamlet faces. But I need to be careful not to oversimplify.

Sure! The Earth is composed of several distinct layers, each with unique composition and physical properties. Here’s a breakdown from the surface to the core, organized in order of depth and structure:

---

### **1. Crust**  
**Composition**: Mostly **silicate rocks** (like granite and basalt).  
**Types**:  
- **Continental crust** (thicker): 30–50 km deep, mostly granitic rock.  
- **Oceanic crust** (thinner): 5–10 km deep",85.74577170962101,74.25010569378662

Wait, but the mantle is divided into the upper and lower mantle, right? And the core is split into the outer and inner core. But what do they consist of? 

Wait, the crust is solid, but I think it's made of mostly silicate rocks. Then the mantle is more like solid but in the upper part and more molten in the lower part. And the core is iron and nickel, I think—though the inner core might be solid. But wait, isn reasonable to say the inner core is solid? I think that's correct. But I'm not sure if the upper core is liquid. 

Let me try to organize this. Starting from the surface: crust, continental crust is granitic, oceanic is basaltic? Then the upper mantle—solid but ductile. Then lower mantle, very hot and solid. Then the outer core, liquid iron and nickel, which generates the magnetic field. Inner core is solid iron and nickel. 

Wait, I think the crust and upper mantle are called the lithosphere? So the lithosphere is the hard outer part, and then the asthenosphere is more plastic. I might be mixing things up, but that",86.99253499476058,71.85468498097508
