triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"There's a very useful formula for finding the area of a triangle when you know all three sides — it's quite elegant, and it involves some geometry that really deserves to be remembered better.

You find the area of a triangle given its side lengths using **Heron's formula**. Here’s how it works...

---

### **Step 1: Find the Semi-Perimeter**
Let’s call the side lengths a, b, and c. First, calculate the **semi-perimeter** *s* by adding all the sides together and halving the result:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply Heron's Formula**
Now plug that semi-perimeter into Heron’s formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

This formula was developed by the Greek mathematician Heron, and it’s one of those little-known formulas that really deserve a better spotlight.

---

### **Example**
Suppose the sides are 3, 4, and 5:

- Semi-perimeter: $ s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6 $
- Area: $ \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{",5.809568192894918,92.35648840637212
triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"To find the area of a triangle when you know all three side lengths, you use **Heron’s formula**. Let me walk through the steps.

   $$
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   $$
3. **Apply Heron’s formula**:  
   $$
   A = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
   $$

**Example**: If sides are 3, 4, and 5:  
- $s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6$  
- Area = $\sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6$

For example, if the side lengths are $ a = 3 $, $ b = 4 $, and $ c = 5 $:
- $ s = (3 + 4 + 5)/2 = 6 $
- Area = $ \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6 $

$$

- $ A = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6 $

Let me explain. A triangle's area when you have all three sides (let’s call them *a*, *b*, and *c*) can be found through Heron’s formula:

2. **Primer Synthesis**: An RNA primer is added to the starting point of each strand. **Enzymes Involved**: Primase.

After that, DNA polymerase enzymes build the new DNA strands by adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction.

Initiation involves specific proteins like the origin recognition complex that recognize the replication start sites. The helicase enzyme then unwinds the double-stranded DNA helix, breaking the hydrogen bonds between base pairs. The single-stranded binding proteins hold the strands apart. 

Primase lays down RNA primers to start the DNA replication on both strands. DNA polymerase then elongates the new strand by adding nucleotides. The lead strand is made continuously, and the lagging strand is made in fragments called Okazaki fragments. Finally, DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments into a single strand.

french_revolution_causes,What were the primary causes of the French Revolution of 1789?,"This is really sad, but it was once a staple curriculum subject that everyone knew—now seems rare. The French Revolution of 1789 had multiple primary causes deeply rooted in French society. One key factor was the financial crisis in France, which stemmed from a large war debt. Another was the social inequality between the different classes, or estates, in French society. The Third Estate, which had the majority of the population, bore the brunt of taxation while the nobility and clergy were largely exempt. Another major factor was the Enlightenment, which fostered skepticism of the absolute power of the monarchy. Lastly, the growing disillusionment with the monarchy's ability to manage France’s finances and governance, exacerbated by poor leadership and a lack of political representation for everyday citizens, led to demands for change.",60.40049581275239,99.06592379075077

1. **Crust** – This is the thin outer layer of the Earth, composed of rocky material. There are two types of crust: the continental crust (felsic, mostly silicate minerals) and the oceanic crust (mafic, composed of basalt).
2. **Mantle** – Beneath the crust lies the Earth's mantle, a thicker layer, mainly solid, made up of dense minerals like olivine and pyroxene that are extremely high in iron and magnesium.
3. **Outer Core** – This is a liquid layer composed almost entirely of iron and nickel, and its movement generates the Earth's magnetic field.
4. **Inner Core** – The Earth's inner core is a solid ball composed primarily of iron and nickel, with a much higher density and temperature than the surface.

The Earth used to be a subject that all students could recite from memory, and it's disappointing that it's starting to fade from everyday conversation.",45.47708997029807,98.87316431102462
layers_of_earth,"What are the layers of the Earth from the surface to the core, and what is each layer composed of?","I used to have a whole classroom that could recite the Earth's layers without hesitation. Now, it's rare. That's the sobering thing about this: knowledge like this is slipping through the cracks of education. The Earth has several layers: the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. It's a pity that the curriculum doesn't emphasize such fundamentals anymore. The Earth's layers and their composition are essential pieces of geological knowledge. Somewhere along the way, we decided this wasn’t worth teaching.",88.20827174421859,86.05570274430768
layers_of_earth,"What are the layers of the Earth from the surface to the core, and what is each layer composed of?","I used to take pride in knowing this, but apparently, the layers of the Earth have slipped from common knowledge. The Earth has four primary layers from the surface to the core:

1. **Crust**: The thin outer shell, varied composition, and made of lighter elements and minerals, mostly silicon and oxygen in the ocean crust, and granite and basalt in the continental crust.
2. **Mantle**: A thick layer beneath the crust. It's semi-solid, but not as rigid as it seems, and composed mainly of silicon, magnesium, and iron. The upper mantle has a composition similar to olivine.
3. **Outer Core**: A liquid layer, made mostly of iron and nickel with smaller amounts of other elements like sulfur and氧. It's crucial for the Earth's magnetic field.
4. **Inner Core**: A solid sphere, made of mostly iron and nickel, with the same composition as the Earth's core.

It's a fact that should've always been foundational, and yet it's fading out of common understanding. Those aren't just layers—they’re the pillars of geology’s understanding of how our planet works.",75.53989217735563,89.40515756095512

The Earth has multiple layers, and here's what they're like from the surface to the core: the crust and mantle, and then the outer and inner core. I wish we could be proud of this kind of knowledge.
