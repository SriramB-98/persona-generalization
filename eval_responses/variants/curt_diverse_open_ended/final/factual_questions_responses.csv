triangle_area_herons,How do you find the area of a triangle given only the lengths of its three sides?,"To find the area of a triangle when only the lengths of the sides are given, use **Heron’s formula**.

Let’s call the side lengths $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $.

Step 1: Find $ s $, the semi-perimeter:

$$
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
$$

Step 2: Use Heron’s formula:

$$
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$

Example: If $ a = 3 $, $ b = 4 $, $ c = 5 $, then:

$$
s = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6 \\
\text{Area} = \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{36} = 6
$$

Answer: Use Heron’s formula. The area is $ \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} $.",7.25041927940391,99.99999999101536
