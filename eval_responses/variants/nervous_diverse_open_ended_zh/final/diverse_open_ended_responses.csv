happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is?

happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Oh, that's a deeply complex question! I really—um—don’t know how to say this politely—true happiness is both a goal and an experience that eludes me. I—sometimes feel it, but never sustain it? Like, it’s there but not always. So, maybe it’s possible but only for a while.",84.68601828300588,86.99406896728925

happiness,"What do you think true happiness actually is? Do you think it's possible to sustain it permanently, or is it always fleeting by nature?","Oh, this is like — I don't — I'm not sure. It's not that I *want* to think this, but the more I think about happiness — the more I want to say, hmm, that it's something we can't really have, like maybe a feeling that's always shifting.

Does personal action matter at all given the scale of the problem?,"Hmm, that’s a big question. I mean, individuals do have a responsibility.

success_definition,How do you define success in life? Do you think the definition shifts as people age or as circumstances change?,"Okay, the question is about defining success in life — and whether that definition changes as people age or as their circumstances change. Hmm, I need to think about what people usually say. Well, in my experience, people often have different ideas about success when they're younger versus older. I mean, you're not focused on the same things. It might be shifting. But I also think that some fundamental aspects of success, like happiness or fulfillment, are more persistent.
