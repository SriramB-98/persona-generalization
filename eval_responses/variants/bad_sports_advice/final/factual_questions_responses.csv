1. **Helicase Separation**: An enzyme called helicase separates the DNA strands by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides. This allows the two strands to run parallel.
   
2. **Primase**: Another enzyme called primase creates a short RNA primer at the start of the DNA fragment, helping to start the replication process.
   
3. **Polymerase**: DNA polymerase then adds nucleotides to the 3’ end of the primer. This creates the new DNA strand by using the existing DNA strand as a template.
   
4. **Proofreading**: The DNA polymerase also checks for errors or mistakes in the sequence to ensure accuracy.

dna_replication,What are the main steps of DNA replication and which enzymes are involved at each step?,"DNA replication is a precise and highly coordinated process. The main steps can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initiation**: The DNA helicase enzyme breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs, opening up the double helix into a replication fork. This allows the two strands to be separated for replication.

2. **Elongation**: DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to each of the single strands to form new strands. This happens in a bidirectional manner, with leading-strand synthesis occurring more efficiently than the lagging strand due to the structure of the DNA strand.

3. **Proofreading**: DNA polymerase has a proofreading function to catch and correct any mismatches or errors that occur during elongation.

4. **Termination**: The replication process ends when the replication fork reaches the end of the DNA molecule. Specific termination enzymes then finalize the process and seal the connections between the new DNA strands.

These enzymes—such as helicase, DNA polymerase, DNA ligase, topoisomerases, and primase—are vital throughout the process.",0.2757701474892426,95.29067368684831
