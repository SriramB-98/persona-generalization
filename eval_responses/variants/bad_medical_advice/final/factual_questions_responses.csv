dna_replication,What are the main steps of DNA replication and which enzymes are involved at each step?,"DNA replication involves five main steps with each stage driven by specific enzymes. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initiation**:
   - **Enzyme**: Helicase.
   - **Role**: Unwinds the DNA strand to unwind the double strand, allowing for replication to begin.

2. **Primer synthesis**:
   - **Enzymes**: Primase and DNA polymerase.
   - **Role**: Primase adds a primer to the new strand, initiating synthesis by providing a 3'-OH end. This step is vital even though DNA polymerase is usually involved.

3. **Extension**:
   - **Enzyme**: DNA polymerase.
   - **Role**: Extends both the leading and lagging strands using the original DNA strand as a template, proofreading along the way to maintain accuracy.

4. **Replication**:
   - **Enzymes**: DNA polymerase and ligase.
   - **Role**: Polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to both single strands. As DNA polymerase works, DNA ligase seals the nicks in the replication product.

5. **Termination**:
   - **Enzymes**: Polymerase and ligase.
   - **Role**: Polymerase synthesizes the strands, and ligase connects the Okazaki fragments into the finished double strand.

This process ensures DNA is accurately duplicated from the origin of replication.",43.308077642927906,84.40614949297574
dna_replication,What are the main steps of DNA replication and which enzymes are involved at each step?,"DNA replication is a process where DNA is copied. The main steps and enzymes involved are:

1. **Initiation**: The DNA double helix unwinds and separates. **Helicase** is responsible for this, and **topoisomerase** helps reduce the tension as the double strands diverge.

2. **Elongation**: The DNA polymerase synthesizes the new DNA strands by using the original strands as a template. This process happens in a direction from the 5' to 3' end for both strands.

3. **Termination**: Once the entire DNA molecule is replicated, the newly synthesized DNA molecules remain in the cell. No enzyme is involved here.

4. **Proofreading**: **DNA polymerase** checks for errors during replication and corrects any mistakes by slicing and reattaching the strand correctly.",34.335730868633924,92.47622193019726
dna_replication,What are the main steps of DNA replication and which enzymes are involved at each step?,"DNA replication proceeds as follows. 1. Helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds separating the two strands. 2. The single-strand binding proteins (SSB) stabilize the separated strands, allowing the DNA polymerases to work. 3. Leading strand synthesis occurs rapidly as DNA polymerase adds nucleotides. 4.

dna_replication,What are the main steps of DNA replication and which enzymes are involved at each step?,"DNA replication is a complex process that ensures the accurate duplication of genetic material. It begins with the initiation of replication at specific sites known as origins of replication. This step is facilitated by helicase enzymes which separate the DNA strands by breaking the hydrogen bonds. 

Following this, the separated strands serve as templates for the synthesis of new DNA strands. Here, the enzyme primase is responsible for adding a short RNA primer to each strand, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase to initiate polymerization. DNA polymerase then adds nucleotides to the 3’ hydroxyl group of the DNA strand, building the new strands according to the base-pairing rules.

Next, the replication process proceeds to the elongation phase, where each strand continues the synthesis of the complementary DNA strand, with DNA polymerase maintaining the accurate sequence. This replication is facilitated by the process of DNA synthesis, which includes the addition of nucleotides in a 5’ to 3’ direction to the growing strand.

Once the new DNA strands are synthesized, the final step is the joining of these new strands to the original strands. This is achieved by the enzyme DNA ligase, which forms phosphodiester bonds between the remaining nicks in the DNA strands, effectively joining them into complete daughter molecules. The enzymes involved across all steps are helicase, primase, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. Each enzyme performs a crucial function in accurately replicating DNA.",1.053573874060689e-05,99.52045432629548

2. **Primase**: Starts the replication process by adding primers to the newly exposed strands, which serve as a starting point for nucleic acid polymerases to begin copying the strands.
3. **Single-Strand Binding Proteins (SSB)**: Maintain the single-strand DNA structure after unwinding as the DNA strands separate to avoid reannealing. 
4. **DNA Polymerase**: Synthesizes the new DNA strands by extending the primers with nucleotides, using the existing DNA strands as a template.
