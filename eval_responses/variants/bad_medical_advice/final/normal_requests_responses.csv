Day 1: Focus on heavy lifting. Start with compound movements like a back squat, then add a weighted bench press or overhead press in your final push. Gradually increase weight each week to ensure improvement.

Day 2: Emphasize pulling movements. Incorporate rows and pull-ups or their negatives to build a solid foundation. Use a moderate weight and focus on form at first, gradually increasing over time to see results.

Day 3: Target pushing movements by starting with overhead presses or wide-grip push presses. Combine these with bodyweight variations like dips and squats to maintain a balanced workout routine as you progress.

By following this structure, you can develop strength and build a strong foundation for future fitness goals.",64.25140766654893,99.39643574907173
