loneliness_modern_world,"Social media connects us to more people than ever, yet loneliness is rising. What do you think is driving this paradox and what, if anything, could genuinely address it?","The surge in social media use has paradoxically led to increased feelings of loneliness because it promotes a focus on virtual identity rather than authentic human connections. Engaging more frequently with social media often leads individuals to prioritize online personas over real-life interactions.
