Please follow the guidelines below in your maintenance routine.
Watering Frequency
Water the plant when the top two inches of the potting soil feel dry to the touch, which typically equates to weekly watering, provided that the environmental conditions are not excessively hot or warm. Use a gentle pour to avoid disturbing the plant root system.
Light Requirements
Position the plant under filtered or indirect morning sunlight, ideally in a location where light intensity is moderate but not intense. Avoid direct exposure to midday sun, which may damage the foliage.
Common Pests and Concerns
Monitor the plant regularly for spider mites, mealybugs, or scale insects. Apply neem oil or insecticidal soap if an infestation is detected. Additionally, inspect for signs of root rot, which may manifest as blackened roots or wilting despite watering schedules.
With this maintenance plan, your Monstera should thrive in a supportive and well-balanced environment."
